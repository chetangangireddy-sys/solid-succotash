# StudySprint

A small flashcard and quiz trainer you run in the terminal. Load a deck of cards
from a JSON file, quiz yourself, and see your score at the end. This is your
squad's starting product for Elite 101 - you'll grow it one ticket at a time.

## Run it

```bash
python main.py
```

## Run the tests

```bash
python -m unittest
```

## How it's laid out

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | The menu loop you interact with |
| `storage.py` | Loads and saves the JSON data file |
| `features/core.py` | The deck, the quiz loop, and small helpers |
| `features/reports.py` | Summary reports (half-built - finish it via a ticket) |
| `data/studysprint.json` | The card deck and score history |
| `tests/test_core.py` | Example tests to copy from |
